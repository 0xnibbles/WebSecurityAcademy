Before blind letters&digits attack, discover the length of the passwrod (with binary search)

Request as an argument a pattern to differ successfull and error responses

Improving arguments parsing - look how linux binares parse the arguments

Get from arguments the payload, the headers or field to attack (example: what cookie)

maybe take a look to request timeout

request a guess for password length(maybe the passwords from a site could have 
restrictions such as minimum and maximum length) -min and max length arguments??

Use req.session.get() to save the cookie in future cases

add more groups of ascii chars to test??
